            <h2>First Day of Class (C#)</h2>
                <p>
                    Oh! C# is a programming language, oten used for Windows programs... this could be really useful! It has variables, loops, and even methods; a lot to learn, but it really opens up doors!
                </p>
            <h2>How to Build Websities! (HTML)</h2>
                <p>
                    What a great day! We learned all about HTML, or, HyperTextMarkupLanguage. It is the content and skeleton of the site. 
                </p>
            <h2>Brand new Topic (CSS)</h2>
                <p>
                    Today we learned about CSS, or, Cascading StyleSheets - how cool! This language helps us make our sites look pretty, we get to deine the styles. 
                </p>
            <h2>Another New Topic?! (JS)</h2>
                <p>
                    Wow! I thought the other languages were pretty neat, but this one takes the cake so far JS, or JavaScript, can be used to bring out websites to LIFE! It is used for functionality within the webpage. 
                </p>
            <h2>Addiing to our JS (TS)</h2>
                <p>
                    Who knew we could use something to check out code for errors and offer addtional features to JavaScript! TS or TypeScript, is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to regular JS. The extra features will come in handy!
                </p>
                <h2>Time to React</h2>
                <p>
                    Our first large JavaScript framework, how exciting! How we can build web components and build more complext front-ends with east... a bit of learning curve but useful now that we're getting the hang of it.
